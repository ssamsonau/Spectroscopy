### Fluorescence


_Sample stage use:_
1. Use blue laser
1. Use blue mirror
2. Focus on sample with using of Thorlabs camera (use darkest ND filter)
4. Take measurements for laser line (keep ND filter in path) - exactly what is excitation wavelength - 405 nm or something else. +/- 2 nm can change a lot for Raman
3. Remove ND filter for actual measurements. Use blue filter!
5. Slit on 5 for good resolution
6. Acquisition time can be low for strong signals (0.01-0.1 sec)
7. In live mode adjust focusing of laser (using objective position control knob) to make the signal detected by Andor camera stronger
8. Collect data


_Cuvette use:_
1. Use blue laser. Direct it to a cuvvete entrance
2. Put sample in cuvvete (liquid, particles in liquid, colloids, powders)
3. Take background spectum with empty quvette at 90 degree exit
5. Take spectrum at 90 degree exit with filled quvette
