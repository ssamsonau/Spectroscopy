### Thickness of thin films

Measurements can be done in Reflection/Backscatter geometry, or in -45 to +45 degrees position 

* Use stand with fiber connectors. 
* -45 to + 45 geometry
    - Fiber from lamp connects to one connector (let say -45 degree)
    - Second fiber is connected to +45 degree. The other end is connected to collimator and directed toward the scpectrometer
* Reflection/Backscatter geometry
    - Use Reflection/Backscatter Probe (we have [Thorlabs RP 20](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7794))
    - [see proper conenction](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7794))
