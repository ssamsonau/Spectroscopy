### Thickness of thin films

### Theory

Given air, film, air situation. One relfection with n2>n1 (+$\lambda/2$). Condition for maxima then $ (m+1/2)\lambda = 2 n d$. 

We get values of $\lambda$ for maxima from spectrum, but how to get m? It may happen that situation of m = 1 is somewhere in IR. For example given n =1.5 and d = 1 um,  $\lambda$ corresponding to m = 1 will be 2 um.  Thus we replace m by m + m0. Where m0 is unknown "shift of m". THis way we can start counting m from the first peak we oberve in long wavlength.

$ (m + m0 +1/2)\lambda = 2 n d$

Make linear equation $$1/\lambda = [\frac{1}{4nd}+ \frac{m0}{2nd} ] + m \frac{1}{2nd}$$

Fit this linear regression to obtain d from the slope (m0 then can be obtained from an intercept if needed)

#### Note:

Note: silver mirrors coated with 100 nm protective SiO2 coating. This can introduce corresponding interference pattern. This by itself creates a certain interference in traveling signal.  See [example](https://www.filmetrics.com/reflectance-calculator?wmin=200&wmax=1000&wstep=1&angle=0&pol=s&units=nm&mmat=Air&mat[]=SiO2&d[]=100&smat=Si&sptype=r)
Calibration is important!


### If index of refraction is not known

If you do not know the refractive index of your material you can measure the interference pattern perpendicularly to your film (as usually) and at other incident angle. You can then calculate refractive index from the shifts of extrema in your measured pattern ([link](https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_to_calculate_thin_film_thickness_from_UV-VIS-NIR_spectrometer_interference_data)).

This can be done using fiber probes

#### Using probes

Measurements can be done in Reflection/Backscatter geometry, or in -45 to +45 degrees position 

* Use stand with fiber connectors. 
* -45 to + 45 geometry
    - Fiber from lamp connects to one connector (let say -45 degree)
    - Second fiber is connected to +45 degree. The other end is connected to collimator and directed toward the scpectrometer
* Reflection/Backscatter geometry
    - Use Reflection/Backscatter Probe (we have [Thorlabs RP 20](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7794))
    - [see proper conenction](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7794))

### Updated sample holder under objective in transmission mode
  
  * Use SLS lamp -> int.sphere->mirror to supply light from underneath. 

### Usign sample positioned on the way of the beam (transmission)

  * Put sample vertically near notch filters
  
### Usign sample positioned under ojbective (reflection)
  * shine SLS lamp toward objective using 50/50 mirror in filter wheel
  * focus and send reflection to spectrometer
  * mapping can be pefrormed using manual or aruduino enabled control of maunal stage
