## Reflectance, Color

* Before doing reflection or absorption measurements with fiber cables: 
connect light source by fiber cable to a collimator. Then position collimator to shine on mirror such a way, that light is approximatelly centered in the cage on the way to spectrograph slit.

### Specular (mirror like)

* Use stand with fiber connectors. 
* -45 to + 45 geometry
    - Fiber from lamp connects to one connector (let say -45 degree)
    - Second fiber is connected to +45 degree. The other end is connected to collimator and directed toward the scpectrometer
* Reflection/Backscatter geometry
    - Use Reflection/Backscatter Probe (we have [Thorlabs RP 20](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7794))
    - [see examples of use](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7794))
* Put a white standard (see bellow)
* Take spectrum with white standard in place 
* Take spectrum with a sample of interest in place (the same distance from fiber cables)
* Calculate reflectance spectrum of a surface under study as (signal from surface)/(signal from white standard)

### Diffuse reflection, Albedo, Color

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection

* Albedo (Latin albedo, "whiteness") is the measure of diffusive reflection of radiation out of the total radiation received by a body ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo), [hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/albedo.html))

* Albedo of various surfaces [image](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/5503869/8080325/8063403/saive1-2756068-large.gif) from [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8063403/figures)

* Example on how to find an albedo of a surface can be found [here](http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/6736/1/inproc_326.pdf)

#### Color, Diffisive reflection, Albedo, Measurement

* Use stand with fiber connectors. 
* -45 to top geometry. Or even off-reflection-plane
    - Fiber from lamp connects to one connector (let say -45 degree)
    - Second fiber is connected to top connector. (if you use would use +45 degree, specular reflection can play a a big role). The other end is connected to collimator and directed toward the scpectrometer. 
    - Even better, if you can position second fiber off the relfection plane, to minimize effects of specular reflection (see [link](https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=57d5ac92f7b67e05927eb848&assetKey=AS%3A405210573885440%401473621138023))
    - The other end is connected to collimator and directed toward the scpectrometer
* Reflection/Backscatter geometry
    - Use Reflection/Backscatter Probe (we have [Thorlabs RP 20](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7794))
    - [see examples of use](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=7794))
* Put a white standard (see bellow)
* Take spectrum with white standard in place 
* Take spectrum with a sample of interest in place (the same distance from fiber cables)
* Calculate reflectance spectrum of a surface under study as (signal from surface)/(signal from white standard)
    
### White standards and Lambertian reflectance

* [Lambertian reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambertian_reflectance) - an ideal "matte" or diffusely reflecting surface. 
    - Closest to an ideal Lambertian surface - [Spectralon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectralon)
    - Another material - [Optical PFTE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjS_rHbpqTZAhUBk1kKHbHLAy4QFghIMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.berghof-fluoroplastics.com%2Ffileadmin%2FDateien-Einpflege%2FSeitenbaum%2FHome-Downloads%2FProdukte%2FPTFE-Produkte%2FOptisches%2520PTFE%2FBerghof_PTFE-Products_Optical-PTFE.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2De5nHstkNF2Fyq8akJizD)
