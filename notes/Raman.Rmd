### Raman spectroscopy

Note: you can use fluorescence target with known fluorescence spectra, as a way to calibrate wavlenght intensity accsross the whole spectrum.

1. Use green laser
2. Focus on sample with using of Thorlabs camera (use darkest ND filter)
4. Take measurements for laser line (keep ND filter in path) - exactly what is excitation wavelength - 532 nm or something else. +/- 2 nm can change a lot for Raman
3. Remove ND filter for actual measurements. Use green filter!
5. Slit on 5 for good resolution
6. Acquisition time on 1sec
7. In live mode adjust focusing of laser (using objective position control knob) to make the signal detected by Andor camera stronger
8. Collect data (1 min, 5 min or longer)
