### Raman spectroscopy

1. Use green laser
2. Focus on sample with using of Thorlabs camera (use darkest ND filter)
4. Take measurements for laser line (keep ND filter in path) - exactly what is excitation wavelength - 532 nm or something else. +/- 2 nm can change a lot for Raman
3. Remove ND filter for actual measurements. Use green filter!
5. Slit on 5 for good resolution
6. Acquisition time on 1sec
7. In live mode adjust focus of laser based on the signal strength detected by Andor camera
8. Collect data (1 min, 5 min or longer)
