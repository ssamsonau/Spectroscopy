### Raman spectroscopy

__Sample stage (under the objective) use:__

  1. Use green or blue laser
  1. Use green or blue mirror
  2. Focus on sample with using of Thorlabs camera (use darkest ND filter)
  4. Take measurements for laser line (keep ND filter in path) - exactly what is excitation wavelength - 532 nm (405 nm) or something else. +/- 2 nm can change a lot for Raman
  3. Remove ND filter for actual measurements. Use green filter!
  5. Slit on 5 for good resolution
  6. Acquisition time on 1sec
  7. In live mode adjust focusing of laser (using objective position control knob) to make the signal detected by Andor camera stronger
  8. Collect data (1 min, 5 min or longer)
  

__Cuvette use:__

  1. Use green laser. Direct it to a cuvvete entrance
  2. Put sample in cuvvete (liquid, particles in liquid, colloids, powders)
  3. Take background spectum with empty quvette at 90 degree exit
  5. Take spectrum at 90 degree exit with filled quvette
  
__Fiber optics probe use:__

1. See procedure for reflection and adjust accordingly
2. In this case however, light from sample should be collected by an integrating sphere, instead of using the collimator - collimator (and fiber itself) refracts different colors differently, thus if used directly it will modify the spectrum under study.
