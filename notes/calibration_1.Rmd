### Calibrate wavelength using gas-discharge lamps

(to be done with each of two diffraction gratings independently)

* [wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-discharge_lamp)
* Lines can be found on NIST websites. For example for Helium [here](https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Handbook/Tables/heliumtable2.htm)
* Use lamp which provides several lines withing VIS range. Then follow this description provided by [Ocean Optics](http://oceanoptics.com/wp-content/uploads/Spectrometer-Wavelength-Calibration-Instructions.pdf) - which explains how to fit formulat connecting wavelength and pixel number p 

* Alternative, potentially more precise method is described [here](http://www.americanlaboratory.com/914-Application-Notes/1596-A-High-Precision-Calibration-Method-for-Spectrometers/)
