### Absorption, Extinction, Scattering


__Cuvette use:__

1. Use white light source (Thorlabs SL201). Direct it's light to cuvette
2. Put sample in cuvvete (liquid, particles in liquid, colloids, powders)
3. Take transmission spectum with empty quvette - "Io"
4. Take transmission spectrum with filled quvette - "It"
5. Take scattered spectrum at 90 degree exit with filled quvette - "Is" if needed

__Optical stand use:__

1. Use white light source (Thorlabs SL201)
2. _Reflectance back to the source:_    
Use a special fiber optics probe designed for reflectance measurement if you are doing those. This probe has a collector of a reflected light around the central core sending an original light. 
    - One can use a reference reflectance material (let say a mirror, to get a reference signal)
    - Then relpace mirror by a sample and collect a signal
3. _Reflecatnce at other angles:_    
One normal fiber optics cable to deliver original light. Another normal cable to collect the reflectance at a desired angle.


__Sample in the way use (absorption, transmission):__

1. Use white light source (Thorlabs SL201)
2. Allight so it goes toward the spectrometer
3. Take reference spectrum
4. Put sample on the way
5. Take a signal spectum


### Basic theory

__Transmittance:__ $$T = It/Io$$

The light which is not transmitted is characterized by:    
$$Extinction = scattering + absorption$$
_Note:_ To make matter worse many resources define extinction as absorption. 

__Extinction is defined as:__

$$E = log_{10}(Io/It) = log_{10}(1/T) = -log_{10}(T)$$

_In case there is no scattering (or it is negligible) - Extinction is equal to Absorption:_

[link](http://sydney.edu.au/science/molecular_bioscience/PHAR2811/Spectrophotometry/Spectrophotometry.ppt%2018.07.08.ppt): Intensity of light decaying exponentially: $$T = \frac{It}{Io} = e^{-\alpha c d}$$, where $\alpha$ is an extinction constant, $c$ is concentration and $d$ is light path length

Taking log on both parts: $$ Ln( \frac{Io}{It})={\alpha c d}$$
Converting to log10 (as absorption usually defined and reported in 10 base):
$$ Log10( \frac{Io}{It})={\varepsilon c d}$$

Now defining absorbance as 

$$A=-log_{10}(T)$$, we have Beer-Lambert's law: $$A = \varepsilon c d$$


_When using cuvette and colloidal solution (or another similar situtaion):_   
Let say you have a colloidal solution of particles in a reference liquid. 
An equation representing absorption of a sample (particles) would be calculated from trasmission loses due to sample part (Trasmission losses of liqued+particles - trasmission losses of liquid) 

$$A_{sample} = -log10(Ir/Io - It/Io)$$
