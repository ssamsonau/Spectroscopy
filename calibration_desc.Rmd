## Main two calibtations

(to be done with each of two diffraction gratings independently)

### Calibrate wavelength using gas-discharge lamps

* [wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-discharge_lamp)
* Lines can be found on NIST websites. For example for Helium [here](https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Handbook/Tables/heliumtable2.htm)
* Alternative, more precise method is described [here](http://www.americanlaboratory.com/914-Application-Notes/1596-A-High-Precision-Calibration-Method-for-Spectrometers/) 

### Calibrate intensity using tungsten-halogen lamp

* We have SLS201 light source from Thorlabs. Data for updated version of the lamp SLS201L [here](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_ID=7269). You can contact company for the data for SLS201
* While calibrating typically we use 3 silver mirrors and a focusing lens in the lightpass before spectrograph
