### Calibrate intensity using tungsten-halogen lamp

* Light passing through/reflecting from optical elements will undergo significant changes in intensity at different wavelengthes. For example these are the curves for installed diffraction gratings 
    - [300/500](http://www.gratinglab.com/Products/Product_Tables/Efficiency/Efficiency.aspx?catalog=53-*-270R) 
    - [1200/600](http://www.gratinglab.com/Products/Product_Tables/Efficiency/Efficiency.aspx?catalog=53-*-340R)
* We have SLS201 light source from Thorlabs. Data for spectrume can be loaded from  [here](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_ID=7269). (Updated version of light source SLS201L has the same bulb, and thus the same spectrum as SLS201.)
* While calibrating typically we use 3 silver mirrors and a focusing lens in the lightpass before spectrograph

* __use of fiber cable and collimator__ 
    - use them during calibration if you are going to characterize source, guiding light through fiber cable and collimator
    - do calibration without them (just use a diafragm) in the other situation

* This calibration is not important for absorbtion/transmittion measurements, as they rely on a relative information for with and without a sample under study

(to be done with each of two diffraction gratings independently)
