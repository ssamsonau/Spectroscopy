### Calibrate intensity using tungsten-halogen lamp

* Light passing through/reflecting from optical elements will undergo significant changes in intensity at different wavelengthes. For example these are the curves for installed diffraction gratings 
    - [300/500](http://www.gratinglab.com/Products/Product_Tables/Efficiency/Efficiency.aspx?catalog=53-*-270R) 
    - [1200/600](http://www.gratinglab.com/Products/Product_Tables/Efficiency/Efficiency.aspx?catalog=53-*-340R)
* We have SLS201 light source from Thorlabs. Data for spectrume can be loaded from  [here](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_ID=7269). (Updated version of light source SLS201L has the same bulb, and thus the same spectrum as SLS201.)
* While calibrating typically we use 3 silver mirrors and a focusing lens in the lightpass before spectrograph

* __Do callibration without use of fiber cable and collimator__ 

(to be done with each of two diffraction gratings independently)
