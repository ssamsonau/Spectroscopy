### Relative Intensity Calibration

* Light passing through/reflecting from optical elements will undergo significant changes in intensity at different wavelengthes. For example these are the curves for installed diffraction gratings 
    - [300/500](http://www.gratinglab.com/Products/Product_Tables/Efficiency/Efficiency.aspx?catalog=53-*-270R) 
    - [1200/600](http://www.gratinglab.com/Products/Product_Tables/Efficiency/Efficiency.aspx?catalog=53-*-340R)
    
    
* One of the approaches to account for that is to do calibration using tungsten lamp

* We have SLS201 light source from Thorlabs (with tugsten-halogen bulb inside). 
    - It features a relativelly stable color temperature of 2796 K (rated for +/- 15 K, at a 48 hour period, not entire life span of the bulb, but we assume it will be stable enough)
    - Data for spectrum can be downloaded from  [here](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_ID=7269). (Updated version of light source SLS201L has the same bulb and temperature, and thus the same spectrum as SLS201)
    
* While calibrating typically we use 4 silver mirrors and a focusing lens in the lightpass before spectrograph

* __use of fiber cable and collimator__ 
    - use them during calibration if you are going to characterize source, guiding light through fiber cable and collimator
    - do calibration without them (just use a diafragm) in the other situation

* This calibration is not important for absorbtion/transmittion measurements, as they rely on a relative information for with and without a sample under study

(to be done with each of two diffraction gratings independently)
