What can be done:
  * Spectrometer calibration
  * Basic operations with Reference, Background, and Signal spectra
  * Fitting
  * Thin film thickness measurements
  * Determination of Color from the final spectra (with position of color on a color diagram)
    
Some common tasks are described in "Notes"
